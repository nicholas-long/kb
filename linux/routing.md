# routing using a linux box
- enable ip forwarding
- add router to routes on hosts
- create iptables rule to forward between 2 interfaces

## enable ip forwarding

### temporarily
```bash
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
```

### permanently
edit `/etc/sysctl.conf`
Add one of the following lines to the bottom of the file, depending on whether youâ€™d like Linux IP forwarding to be off or on, respectively. 
Then, save your changes to this file.
The setting will be permanent across reboots.
The net.ipv4.ip_forward setting controls whether IP forwarding is turned on or off for IPv4.
```
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
```
After editing the file, you can run the following command to make the changes take effect right away.
```
# sysctl -p
```

## add router to routes on hosts

### windows
192.168.1.69 is the router?
this forwards 10.10.10.0/24 through 192.168.1.69
```dos
route add 10.10.10.10 mask 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.69
route print
```

## iptables rules

### forward all traffic between two interfaces
```bash
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
iptables -A FORWARD -i tun0 -o wlan0 -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
iptables -A FORWARD -i wlan0 -o tun0 -j ACCEPT
# from stackoverflow
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o tun0 -j MASQUERADE
# alternative: check source address is eth0 #ippsec video sharp
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 192.168.1.0/24 -o tun0 -j MASQUERADE
```
