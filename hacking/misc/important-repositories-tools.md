## simple
github gist superkojiman/namemash.py
https://gist.github.com/superkojiman/11076951

## output all formats by omitting format parameter
```bash
./username-anarchy -i test-names.txt
```
## generate common usernames for country or top 10k names from facebook
```bash
./username-anarchy -a -c us
```
COUNTRY can be one of the following datasets: switzerland, uk, us,
argentina, austria, belgium, canada, china, denmark, france, germany, hungary, india, ireland,
italy, luxembourg, netherlands, newzealand, norway, poland, serbia, slovenia, spain, sweden
Other: Facebook - uses the Facebook top 10,000 names - don't run this with all formats

## krbrelayx.py Kerberos relaying and Unconstrained delegation abuse
When no credentials are supplied, but at least one target is specified, krbrelayx will forward the Kerberos authentication to a matching target hostname, effectively relaying the authentication. How to get incoming Kerberos auth with a valid SPN is up to you, but you could use mitm6 for this.
In this mode, krbrelayx will either decrypt and dump incoming TGTs embedded in authentication with unconstrained delegation, or immediately use the TGTs to authenticate to a target service. This requires that credentials for an account with unconstrained delegation are specified.
