# windows privilege escalation
- check for local ports
- whoami /all
  - SeImpersonate -> rogue potato
  - backup permissions
- permissions
  - applications that run as SYSTEM
  - write permissions
- enum users and groups
- service account with low privileges -> recover default privileges
- horizontal escalation - service users may have privileges
- common general enumeration stuff
  - enumerate installed applications and configs 
    - hunt for creds ( appdata, lazagne )
    - saved RDP and and credential manager
    - saved SSH keys on filesystem and in regsitry
    - IIS web configs
    - hacktricks "Possible filenames containing credentials"
- user data
  - clipboard
  - powershell history
  - credentials manager ( cmdkey )
  - appdata
    - browser data - dump with tools like SharpChromium
- running processes
  - dump memory with procdump from sysinternals
- headline exploits from privesc to try list

- check exploits / vulnerabilities found during enumeration
  - leaked credentials
  - potential privesc exploits
  - vulnerable services running as SYSTEM
- java web -> find website code packaged into war file
  - secrets, config, hardcoded creds
- no access to read webroot -> try appending known filenames to path to read
