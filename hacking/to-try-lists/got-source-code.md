# got source code - analysis
- secrets / creds
- paths and filenames
- grep vulnerable functions
- security antipatterns
- test code locally / vm / container
  - custom code and vulnerable third party lib exploits
- targets
  - code execution
  - file access
- deserialization vulnerabilities
- templates
- vulnerable third party libraries
- git repositories and history log
- vulnerabilities common to the programming language
  - PHP
    - common antipatterns:
      - including code based on user imput
      - SQLi
        - mysqli_multi_query -> stacked ; queries
          - update
    - code execution
    - eval
    - assert
    - regular expressions that execute code
    - fuzzy equal
      - type juggling http post data (JSON, XML, url encoded)
    - laravel : SQLi with `whereRaw` for manipulating raw query
  - python
    - eval
    - pickle
    - jinja
    - web servers running in debug mode
  - ruby
    - mass assignment
  - javascript
    - JSON object prototype pollution
      - recommend local testing - potentially destructive to server - revert
      - `__proto__` and `__proto__.__proto__`
    - fuzzy equal
  - golang
    - user input to controllers -> `http.Request`
    - shell exec -> `exec.Command`
    - os.Open - read files
    - `filepath.Clean` with no leading / -> no filtering of `../`
  - C
    - buffer lengths
    - pointers
    - printf, fprintf, sprintf and other forms with user supplied format strings
    - system()
      - not full path to executable -> PATH injection
    - loops and off by one `<` vs `<=`
