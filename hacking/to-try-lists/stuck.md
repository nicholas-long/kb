# Stuck to try list
- update notes -> relax
  - summarize machine into page: files, services, summary details
  - update steps to keep track of things you did
  - reprioritize / cleanup to try list
- eat
- try to find obscure article / writeup / bug report / bounty mentioning combination of services / vendors
- try thinking of ways to combine the information I have in a new way
  - i.e. usernames and dirbusting wordlists
- check relevant chapters in book / hacktricks
- check payloadsallthethings for payload chain ideas
- things that suspiciously don't work -> can be a finding
- search on sites for related keywords to get ideas
  - ippsec.rocks
  - github issues
  - fuzzing around with google search criteria
