# figure out what to do with this
- web 200 has list of things to try for http
- need
  - common commands
    - use env vars for parameter positions?
- wfuzz instead of dir busting for thorough enumeration
  - use low threads in the real world "zombie busting"
  - fuzz all lists
    - separate into individual tasks and try small ones first
    - eventually do big ones and be patient
  - properly filter output
    - 403 can be important, don't exclude
    - hide dotfiles or other noise 
      - if there's noise, can hide by content length
- section for each svc enumerated like before
  - trim output and bring things to the to try list

# quick tools
