# pwn methodology / to try list
- strings
- system commands
  - injection
  - no path for shell commands -> privesc
- buffer overflow
  - executable stack -> find `jmp esp` or equivalent
  - NX -> ropchain
    - ropgadget
- format string
  - arbitrary read with `%s` refering to attacker controlled argument
  - index arguments with 
  - pwntools FmtStr
  - everything from arbitrary write -> ...
  - overwrite return address
  - write rop chain to get execution
- memory access
  - arbitrary write
    - overwrite function addresses in the global offset table
      - control argument -> point to system, easy RCE
    - write malloc hook in libc if program uses dynamic memory allocation
    - shellcode
    - libc hooks on close
    - function table
  - arbitrary read
    - leak libc addresses -> lookup in libc database
    - leak stack address with environ symbol in libc - points to enviornment vars which are at top of stack
- heap overflow
  - write function / vtable pointers to dynamically allocated objects right afterwards in memory
  - corrupt data or strings used elsewhere
- heap corruption - hard
  - identify correct type of house
  - patch to older libc version
    - heap exploit houses can get fixed in newer libc versions
- canaries enabled with overflow on a forking server -> brute force canaries
